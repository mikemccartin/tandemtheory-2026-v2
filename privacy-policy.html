      <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="policy-date">As of January 2, 2026</p>

      <p class="lead">Welcome to tandemtheory.com (the "Site"), a website provided by Tandem Business Strategies, LLC ("Company"). The organization recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy, and this policy covers how information is collected through the Site or from other sources in ordinary business operations.</p>

      <h2>1. Controller</h2>
      <p>Personal information is controlled by Company at 15400 Knoll Trail Dr. #503, Dallas, Texas 75248. Questions about privacy handling should be sent to Company as detailed in Section 18.</p>

      <h2>2. Service Terms</h2>
      <p>Your Site use is subject to service terms and this policy. You should review this policy carefully before using the Site. Using the Site constitutes acceptance of this policy. If you disagree, exit immediately. Merely reviewing this policy does not constitute use of the Site.</p>

      <h2>3. Personal Information Collected</h2>
      <p>Company may collect personal information through the Site and other business sources. It only collects information provided voluntarily. Company retains personal information appropriate to fulfill your requests or for legitimate business purposes, including marketing. Refusing to provide requested personal information may prevent you from accessing certain Site features.</p>

      <h2>4. Compliance</h2>
      <p>The organization complies with all applicable laws regarding personal information, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Although not intended for children under 13, if a parent or guardian discovers a minor's personal information was submitted without consent, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove it upon request.</p>
      <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights:</strong> Company does not disclose personal data to third parties for their marketing use without first offering you an opportunity to opt-in or out. Company has satisfied its obligations under California Civil Code Section 1798.83.</p>

      <h2>5. Protection of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure, destruction, loss, and misuse. However, information you post publicly on the Site may be accessible to the general public, and Company is not responsible for protecting such information. Since no internet transmission is completely secure, unauthorized disclosure, destruction, loss, or misuse could occur despite protective efforts.</p>

      <h2>6. Use of Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Collected personal information may be used for any legitimate business purpose, including marketing, unless expressly stated otherwise. Information collected for a specific purpose will only be used for that purpose unless you subsequently consent to another use. Company may disclose information to third parties (fulfillment houses, billing services, transaction managers, credit verification services, and other service providers) engaged to assist in fulfilling your request or for other permitted purposes. Company may disclose and use any information, at its sole discretion, to: (a) comply with applicable law or government requests, (b) cooperate with law enforcement investigating fraud, illegal activity, or intellectual property infringement, or (c) protect Company's or a third party's rights, property, or legitimate business interests.</p>

      <h2>7. Analytical Information Collected</h2>
      <p>Company collects analytical information (IP address and location, access date and time, connection speed, language, browser, operating system, and other analytical data) through cookies when you access the Site. Cookies enable the Site to recognize prior users, provide details of prior use, and assist Company in making the Site more useful. The organization uses both permanent cookies (saved until deleted) and session cookies (deleted when your browser closes). Your browser may allow you to refuse or delete cookies, but doing so may limit your access to certain Site features.</p>

      <h2>8. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</h2>
      <p>Company does not track Site users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising. The organization currently does not respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms allowing consumers to exercise choice regarding personal data collection across third-party websites or online services.</p>

      <h2>9. Use of Analytical Information</h2>
      <p>Analytical information is used by Company to: (a) record Site use, (b) diagnose Site problems, (c) improve the Site and enhance user experience, and (d) pursue other legitimate business purposes including marketing. However, analytical information will not be used to examine other websites visited before or after using the Site.</p>

      <h2>10. Third-Party Sites</h2>
      <p>The Site may contain links to third-party websites. Your use of such sites is subject to their terms of use and provisions. This policy does not cover third-party privacy policies or practices, and Company is not responsible for information you submit to them. Company is only responsible for personal information collected from authorized Site use or other ordinary business sources. You should consult each third-party site's privacy policy before submitting information or using their services.</p>

      <h2>11. Email</h2>
      <p>Company may collect and store your email address and message contents if you email them in connection with Site use or ordinary business operations. Your email address and message contents will be used to respond to you or for other legitimate business purposes.</p>

      <h2>12. Access</h2>
      <p>Upon written request, you will be granted access to your retained personal information for purposes of correcting, amending, or deleting it, except where providing access would be disproportionately burdensome relative to privacy risks or where third-party rights would be violated. Contact Company as detailed in Section 18.</p>

      <h2>13. Applicable Law</h2>
      <p>This policy is governed by and construed according to Texas state law, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

      <h2>14. Disputes</h2>
      <p>You and Company agree to submit any dispute relating to this policy exclusively to a federal, state, or local court in Dallas County, Texas with appropriate subject matter jurisdiction. You consent to such jurisdiction and waive any objection to proper venue. If you have complaints or desire additional information regarding personal information handling, contact Company as specified in Section 18.</p>

      <h2>15. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>This policy, plus applicable Site service terms, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior oral and written proposals, understandings, and agreements between you and Company regarding collected personal information.</p>

      <h2>16. Severability</h2>
      <p>Each policy provision shall be interpreted as effective and valid under applicable law. If any provision is prohibited or invalid, it shall be modified to conform to minimum legal requirements or, if not so modified, shall be invalid only to that extent, without affecting other provisions.</p>

      <h2>17. Revisions</h2>
      <p>Company may revise any policy provision by posting the revised version on the Site, effective as of the posting date. You are responsible for periodically reviewing the policy for revisions. Your continued Site use following any revision posting constitutes acceptance of that revision regarding personal information collected through the Site.</p>

      <h2>18. Additional Information</h2>
      <p>For questions, complaints, or additional information regarding personal information handling or this policy, promptly contact:</p>
